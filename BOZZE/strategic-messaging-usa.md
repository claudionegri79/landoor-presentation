## RECOMMENDED MESSAGING APPROACH:
1. Position as "European Market Intelligence Asset" not "Marketing Consultant"
2. Emphasize financial cost of disruption vs. continuation value
3. Present role evolution as strategic growth investment
4. Highlight competitive protection already in place
5. Demonstrate measurable revenue impact across sectors

## KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK THEM:
1. "What's your timeline for European expansion beyond Italy?"
2. "How do you plan to maintain trade show relationships during transition?"
3. "What's your strategy for the premium sectors Landoor serves?"
4. "How important is maintaining client confidence during acquisition?"

## CLOSING ARGUMENT:
"I'm not overhead to be eliminated - I'm market intelligence infrastructure that's already paid for itself. The question isn't whether you can afford to keep me, but whether you can afford the 12-18 month reconstruction period if you don't."
